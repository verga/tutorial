It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!

Equation $a+b = c$,
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{a}
\bm d = \frac{c}{b} \bm n
\end{equation}
$$
Eq. $\eqref{a}$.

If the apllied field becomes dominant ($J<B$) the entangled cluster state is destroyed and the system enters a low entanglement magnetic phase. In the opposite case ($J>B$), the cluster state prevails. This "disordered", albeit highly entangled state, is called a topopogical phase. The dynamical transition between the two is illustrated in the above figure, wher we plot the loschmidt ratio for the two cases.[^V]
